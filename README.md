# UFO_Module11_Senthil_Gurumoorthi


Five Filters were added in the table that includes:

-Date
-City
-State
-Country
-Shape

Handleclick function was updated to include these filters and also "index.html" is updated based on the js change.  

If-else function was used to allow for these filters to function.  d3.selectAll() has a listener to pick the inputs from the filter. 

Recommendation:  Country data is less relevant as the US is the only country identified.  

We can consider duration to perform additional analysis as this will pave way to consider outliers and trim the dataset further for getting the narrative.

Folder structure was properly made and the js files were available in the repository.  Clean website with the functioning filter table is available as well.
